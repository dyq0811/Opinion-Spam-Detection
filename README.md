# Opinion Spam Detection

All details are discussed in [this paper](https://github.com/dyq0811/Opinion-Spam-Detection-BiRCNN/blob/master/final_paper.pdf).

- To run the bi-directional rcnn model, navigate to the rcnn directory in the terminal and run:
$ python3 train.py

- To run the svm model, open the jupyter notebook called svm in the svm folder.

- To run the scnn model, first move the data folder from the rcnn folder to the scnn folder. Then open the jupyter notebook called training in the scnn folder. You may need to download the corpus at https://github.com/mmihaltz/word2vec-GoogleNews-vectors used to train the text processor. This is too big to be included in the submission.
